Requirements:
    Lazy loading on feature demand
    full access through the application (all features core included)

Descriptions:
    the commands should be accessible in the presentation logic, so the presentation logic will, in turn, receive them,
    as constructor arguments.
    like so:
        HiveManagementModel(AddHiveCmnd, FetchHivesCmnd, FetchHiveCmnd, ...);
    all of these command objects should be instantiated in a form of injector algorithm.
